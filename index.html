    <h1>Transform Your Body. Empower Your Mind.<br> With Elisha – Online Personal Training Redefined</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p>Welcome to the evolution of fitness — where training is not just about the body, but about igniting the fire within. This is your personal invitation to transform from ordinary to elite. This is where hustle meets harmony, where sweat becomes scripture, and every drop counts toward the strongest version of you.</p>

    <p>Imagine a powerful silhouette mid-squat in a dimly lit gym — not a model, but a warrior in progress. Muscles defined, eyes locked with purpose, the room silent except for the breath of effort. That image isn't inspiration — it's transformation. And it's yours to own.</p>

    <p>I’m Elisha — your guide through the grind. With 5 certifications, over 175 transformations, and a mission to train the body and awaken the mind, my methods cut through the noise. No gimmicks. Just science, sweat, and serious results.</p>
